A guide to learning and using the SAMLSmith SAML response forging tool

## Overview

SAMLSmith is a multi-purpose SAML response forging tool. It is designed to allow you to forge/spoof a SAML response from an identity provider (IdP).

If you can forge a SAML reponse, you can effectively act as the identity provder, and gain access to the application [service provider] (SP) as any user in that system.

The purpose of this guide is to help you understand SAML response forging, as well as how to perform it. Further, the guide contains some basic information about difference mechanisms of SAML and how they can, or cannot, defend against response forging.
